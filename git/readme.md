# GIT COMMAND MANUAL
This is a git command summary, which is used in exercises on a really good [visible and interactive learning-git website ](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
## Main Here:
1. git commit
2. git branch your_branch_name
git checkout -b your_branch_name
-> create a new branch AND check it out at the same time
3. git merge
4. git rebase parent_branch
-> used for add the different commits from current HEAD branch to parent_branch

## Remote Here
1. git clone

> Commands used to initialize the local repo and push up to remote repo can be seen in the [List](./cmdList.txt)
